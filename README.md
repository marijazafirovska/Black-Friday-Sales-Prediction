# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction

<h3>Project description</h3>

A retail company wants to understand the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories.
They have shared a purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. 

The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city type, stay in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month. 

<i>Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products <i>.
  
Your goal in this project is to create a robust regression model, that will use this data to predict the customers' total purchase amount for different products. 
  
  The project will be presented through the following stages:

## Understanding the Business
<p>
The first Friday after Thanksgiving has been considered as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season in the USA since 1952. 
There are few theories how this day received its name. According to one of them, in the 1950s, many manages of companies started to call the first Friday after Thanksgiving as Black Friday due to reported sick leave from many of their workers on this day.
Years later, Black Friday was used by Philadelphia cops to describe the day after Thanksgiving because they had to work extended hours in terrible traffic. 

According to the most frequently present theory, on this day, occur 30- 40% of the total annual retail sales, and this is the period of the year when financial books move " from red into the black".  The previous comes from the old bookkeeping practice of recording profits in black ink and losses in red ink. 

However, in the last years the classic Black Friday has been replaced by the Cyber Black Friday, which is marketing word for its online version. The term was first used in 2009 in a press release entitled "Black Friday Goes Online for Cyber Black Friday".

Retailers develop their Black Friday sales plans and strategies entire year. They use different strategies, but mostly they offer low prices for overstock inventory and different discounts on seasonal products.
Additionally, high discounts for expensive brands of TVs, smart devices, and other electronics are offered. Also, special attention is paid on the Black Friday advertisements content, directed towards driving highest sales.
As a result of the previous, can be concluded how important is for retailers to have excellent knowledge of their costumerâ€™s behavior, and accordingly, to implement the best marketing strategies for each customer segment.
